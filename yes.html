    <h2>You Chose YES</h2>
    <h2>Why It's Okay to Use AI for Art</h2>

    <h3>Art Always Evolves with Technology</h3>
    <p>
      From cave paintings to digital tablets, artists have always used new tools to express their ideas.
      Artificial intelligence is just the latest chapter in this long tradition &mdash; a modern medium that opens new doors for creativity.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Makes Art More Accessible</h3>
    <p>
      AI allows more people to participate in art. You don't need to be a trained painter or illustrator to bring your ideas to life.
      People with disabilities, beginners, or those with limited time can all explore their creativity thanks to AI-powered tools.
    </p>

    <h3>Humans Are Still in Control</h3>
    <p>
      AI doesn't create on its own. It responds to input &mdash; words, prompts, sketches &mdash; provided by a person.
      The artist still decides what to make, how to refine it, and what message it carries.
      Like any other tool, AI supports the artist's vision, not the other way around.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Can Be a Creative Partner</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes artists use AI to brainstorm, explore new ideas, or discover unexpected combinations of colours and shapes.
      It can help unblock creativity or spark inspiration, just like talking to another artist might.
    </p>

    <h3>Art Is About Impact, Not Just Process</h3>
    <p>
      A drawing made by hand and an image made with AI can both make people feel something.
      The emotional impact, message, or beauty of a piece isn't limited by how it was made.
      If it moves someone or tells a story, then it is valid art.
    </p>

    <h3>Change Brings New Possibilities</h3>
    <p>
      Every new tool has raised questions &mdash; from photography to digital design &mdash; but each one added something valuable to the world of art.
      AI is no different. With thoughtful use, it can help artists push boundaries and imagine new futures for creative expression.
