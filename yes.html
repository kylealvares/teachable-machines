    <h2>You Chose NO</h2>
    <h2>Why Some People Say AI Shouldn't Be Used for Art</h2>

    <h3>It Can Take Work Away from Artists</h3>
    <p>
      When companies or individuals use AI instead of hiring real artists, it can reduce job opportunities for people who make a living from their creativity.
      Artists often spend years learning their craft, and it can feel unfair when a machine is used to replace their work.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Art Often Uses Other People's Work</h3>
    <p>
      Many AI tools are trained on images from the internet &mdash; including work by real artists who didn't give permission.
      Some people believe this is a form of copying or stealing, even if the AI makes something new.
      It raises questions about fairness and ownership.
    </p>

    <h3>It Can Make Art Feel Less Personal</h3>
    <p>
      Art is a way for people to share their stories, emotions, and culture.
      Critics argue that because AI doesn't have feelings, its creations lack the personal touch that makes human-made art so special and meaningful.
    </p>

    <h3>It Might Be Misused</h3>
    <p>
      AI art can be used to spread misinformation or create fake images that confuse people.
      Without clear rules, it's easy for someone to use these tools in harmful ways, which could hurt trust in digital art in general.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning to Make Art Is Important</h3>
    <p>
      Making art teaches patience, self-expression, and problem-solving.
      If people skip learning these skills because AI can do it for them, they might miss out on the growth and satisfaction that come from creating something by hand.
    </p>

    <h3>We Need to Protect Original Ideas</h3>
    <p>
      Artists work hard to create unique styles and voices.
      If AI tools mimic these styles without permission or credit, it can feel like those original ideas are being taken without respect.
